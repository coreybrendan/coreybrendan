### Hello, friend! 👋

I'm Corey — a front-end developer and recent Bootcamp grad out of Juno College. I'm totally nuts about creative web design and love crafting an engaging (and accessible!) user experience. A little about me:

- 🙋‍♂️ My pronouns are he/him
- 💻 Working as a Jr. Developer in Toronto, Ontario 🇨🇦
- 😎 My portfolio for perusing: https://codewithcorey.com
- 🌈 Forever honing my CSS craft
- 🥷 Currently levelling up my vanilla JavaScript skills
- 🗯 Fun Fact: I'm a dedicated dog-dad to a sweet Boston Terrier pup and plant-dad to lots of leafy, green friends

Thanks for reading, cheers!
